## An offline untrained chatbot with some training data.

<samp>

Hi there. This is a chatbot template for offline chatbots. Export a whastapp .txt file as chat.txt to get the training data

**USE IDLE OR JUPYTER NOTEBOOK TO RUN -- DO NOT USE VS-CODE -- *<br>
*I think technically you could use an online compiler like [repl](https://replit.com/) but I'm not sure why you would given that the point is for this to be OFFLINE*

### NOTICE
*Once having started training the training will be stored in the following 3 files:*
<br/>
*1. db.sqlite3*<br/>
*2. db.sqlite3-shm*<br/>
*3. db.sqlite3-wal*
<br/>
*Delete these files to retrain model from scratch (Get rid of unwanted data)*<br/>
