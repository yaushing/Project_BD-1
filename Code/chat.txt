26/01/2023, 21:54 - X001829N: Yes they are still my friends even though they are very very annoying
27/01/2023, 07:13 - X11578009N: Nice. I wish I could tolerate people better

27/01/2023, 10:34 - X11578009N: I started school recently.
27/01/2023, 10:34 - X11578009N: Where are you going to school?
27/01/2023, 10:34 - X11578009N: I'm going to SST.

27/01/2023, 10:34 - X11578009N: I like it so far. My classes are pretty good right now.
27/01/2023, 18:28 - X11578009N: It's an ugly day today.
27/01/2023, 18:28 - X11578009N: I know. I think it may rain.
27/01/2023, 18:28 - X11578009N: It's the middle of summer; it shouldn't rain today.
27/01/2023, 18:33 - X001829N: It is always summer in Singapore though.
27/01/2023, 19:08 - X11578009N: Too true
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: Does it rain in summer in Singapore though?
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: That would be weird.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: Yeah, especially since it's thirty degrees outside.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: I know, it would be horrible if it rained and was hot outside.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: Yes, it would be.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: I wish it wasn't so hot every day.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: Me too. I can't wait until the rainy season.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: I like the rainy season too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: I'd rather be cold than hot.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: It doesn't look very nice outside today.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: That wouldn't seem right.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: Considering that it's over thirty degrees outside, that would be weird.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: I know, you're right.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: I wish it would cool off one day.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: That's how I feel, I want the monsoon season to come soon
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: I enjoy the monsoon season, but it gets really cold sometimes.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: I know what you mean, but i'd rather be cold than hot.
27/01/2023, 20:43 - X11578009N: I wish it was a nicer day today.
27/01/2023, 21:16 - You added Sean
27/01/2023, 21:20 - You removed Sean
28/01/2023, 15:12 - X11578009N: Did you know that in Singapore it's almost always hot?
28/01/2023, 15:13 - X001829N: Yes though it can be very annoying.
28/01/2023, 15:13 - X11578009N: When I grow up, I want to go to a colder country. Perhaps it will be nicer there
28/01/2023, 15:16 - X001829N: That’s a good idea, I wonder what it’s like in a country that has snow.
28/01/2023, 15:16 - X11578009N: Probably nice. But imagine if it gets super cold!
28/01/2023, 15:17 - X001829N: Better make sure you bring enough clothes to deal with the cold if you ever travel.
28/01/2023, 15:18 - X11578009N: Thanks, I will keep that in mind
28/01/2023, 16:13 - X11578009N: There's something wrong with my right hand
28/01/2023, 16:21 - X001829N: Uh, what happened to you?
28/01/2023, 16:27 - X11578009N: I don't know
29/01/2023, 19:22 - X11578009N: I think I'm writing too much. It probably hurts from writing.
29/01/2023, 19:27 - X001829N: Can you even feel pain?
30/01/2023, 11:28 - X11578009N: I think so. It's a weird feeling
30/01/2023, 12:33 - X001829N: Indeed, it is.
31/01/2023, 13:32 - X11578009N: Do you like sleeping?
31/01/2023, 13:42 - X001829N: Sometimes, if I do it too much I feel unproductive.
31/01/2023, 15:04 - X11578009N: So you like to be productive?
31/01/2023, 17:08 - X001829N: Yup, I feel happier if I do things in the day.
31/01/2023, 18:44 - X11578009N: Cool. I am way too lazy to do much work.
31/01/2023, 18:48 - X001829N: If you aren't doing work, what do you do in the day?
31/01/2023, 18:52 - X11578009N: Procrastinate. I'm more alert past 10pm though
31/01/2023, 18:52 - X001829N: Isn't that when you sleep though?
31/01/2023, 19:02 - X11578009N: I sleep at 11. I would sleep earlier but i work better past 10
31/01/2023, 19:10 - X001829N: Oh, nice. I sleep at 11 too!
03/02/2023, 22:20 - X11578009N: I miss not having a lot of work
04/02/2023, 07:54 - X001829N: Same. Especially since I take a lot of notes as well.
05/02/2023, 16:00 - X11578009N: Why do you work so much?
08/02/2023, 14:59 - X11578009N: I don't know
10/02/2023, 13:55 - X11578009N: I like to sleep. Do you?
10/02/2023, 13:58 - X001829N: Sometimes. Why do you like to sleep?
03/03/2023, 19:32 - X11578009N: It is relaxing and I can just forget everything
03/03/2023, 19:33 - X001829N: What helps you to relax?
03/03/2023, 19:35 - X11578009N: Books. I like reading books.
03/03/2023, 19:36 - X001829N: Cool. I like reading too. What books do you read?
03/03/2023, 19:43 - X11578009N: Fiction and adventure. They transport me to another world.
03/03/2023, 19:44 - X001829N: Ooh nice.
03/03/2023, 19:44 - X11578009N: Thank you! What kind of books do you read?
03/03/2023, 19:45 - X001829N: Fantasy. I love learning about the world building.
03/03/2023, 20:19 - X11578009N: What do you mean by world building?
03/03/2023, 20:21 - X001829N: As in the environment of the setting and how certain elements like say a magic system work.
03/03/2023, 20:29 - X11578009N: Oh. Thank you for elaborating!
03/03/2023, 20:29 - X001829N: No problem.
03/03/2023, 21:36 - X11578009N: Can I ask whether you code?
03/03/2023, 21:44 - X001829N: Yeah I do.
03/03/2023, 22:17 - X11578009N: Which language do you code in?
04/03/2023, 09:31 - X001829N: I learnt python and did a bit of C# but I don’t really code much anymore.
04/03/2023, 10:43 - X11578009N: Why not?
04/03/2023, 10:47 - X001829N: Busy with schoolwork and I have other hobbies.
04/03/2023, 10:57 - X11578009N: Oh. What are some of your hobbies?
04/03/2023, 10:58 - X001829N: Digital drawing and playing the piano though I switch to other hobbies sometimes
04/03/2023, 10:58 - X11578009N: Cool! I wish I could play the piano.
04/03/2023, 10:59 - X001829N: Yeah it’s fun.
04/03/2023, 10:59 - X11578009N: Do you enjoy it?
04/03/2023, 10:59 - X001829N: Yeah. I have lessons every sunday
27/03/2023, 10:15 - X11578009N: What's your favourite piano song?
27/03/2023, 10:34 - X001829N: I don't really have one. The songs I play are mainly pop songs.
27/03/2023, 11:23 - X11578009N: Cool! But wouldn't you play classical too?
27/03/2023, 12:13 - X001829N: I'm just not much of a fan of classical music
29/03/2023, 12:36 - X11578009N: I prefer classical music. Do you enjoy singing the songs you play?
29/03/2023, 12:45 - X001829N: Yeah, I normally choose songs that I've sung before
