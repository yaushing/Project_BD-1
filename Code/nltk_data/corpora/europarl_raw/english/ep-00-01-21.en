 
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting Mr President , I simply wanted to pass on some news .
There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid .
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died .
On behalf of my Group , I once again condemn these terrorist acts .
Thank you , Mrs Fraga Est√©vez .
We had heard about this regrettable incident .
Unfortunately , the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society .
I note your comments with particular keenness , as you may expect , given that I too am Spanish .
( The Minutes were approved )
