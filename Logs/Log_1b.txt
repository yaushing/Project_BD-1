This is the first log. 

00:00:04 Speaker 1 

It has occurred to me that a back jointed knee provides more stability than a regular forward facing knee terms of human. 

00:00:14 Speaker 1 

So for my robot I'll be dismantling. 

00:00:34 Speaker 1 

I'll be dismantling Winston here to build it. 

00:00:41 Speaker 1 

Yeah, the legs will be back during third would be a single. 

00:00:47 Speaker 1 

Cuboid at the start for the brain for the  

00:00:53 Speaker 1 

Conversation and the chat 

00:00:54 Speaker 1 

Bot to work. 

00:00:58 Speaker 1 

It occurs to me that it must have a gyro, but. 

00:01:04 Speaker 1 

I don't think I can connect onto an arduino. 

00:01:10 Speaker 1 

In the meantime, well. 

00:01:13 Speaker 1 

School starts on Tuesday. 

00:01:16 Speaker 1 

So I guess I have to collect my Arduino soon. 

00:01:22 Speaker 1 

In the meantime, I'll start building the chassis from Winston. 

00:01:27 Speaker 1 

There's the main chassis itself and the legs. 

00:01:32 Speaker 1 

After that we might see. 

00:01:35 Speaker 1 

Anyways, the time now is 1305. 

00:01:42 Speaker 1 

So yeah. 

00:01:52 Speaker 1 

And I think in school for robotics after I fell. 

00:02:00 Speaker 1 

I think I'll try to get. 

00:02:03 Speaker 1 

Approval to do a project to try and build the bipedal robot. 

00:02:07 Speaker 1 

This one would be powered by Spike, which already has its own gyro, so that wouldn't be a problem. 

00:02:16 Speaker 1 

Well, now it's. 

00:02:21 Speaker 1 

It is 1305
