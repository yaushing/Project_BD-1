This is, I think the 6th log. It is the 2nd of January 2023. Time now is 1232. 

00:00:10 Speaker 1 

All of the files have been transferred to the Windows PC. 

00:00:14 Speaker 1 

And preliminary tests indicates it is good to go. 

00:00:20 Speaker 1 

It has generated the training data and it's now training the model. 

00:00:23 Speaker 1 

So yeah, fingers crossed. 

00:00:27 Speaker 1 

Well, I've managed to build the translation. 

00:00:38 Speaker 1 

So alright hello world just to show. 

00:00:52 Speaker 1 

It's not the nicest to hear, but it works, so I'm keeping it. 

00:01:01 Speaker 1 

Yeah, I still haven't bought the hardware yet. 

00:01:05 Speaker 1 

ESP does kits. 

00:01:08 Speaker 1 

But well. 

00:01:11 Speaker 1 

Tensor flow is working so fast now train. 

00:01:16 Speaker 1 

So I guess it works. 

00:01:19 Speaker 1 

I think I have. 

00:01:20 Speaker 1 

I think I'm gonna have to add this as a repo to my GitHub. 

00:01:26 Speaker 1 

But I'm not going to do that yet. 

00:01:28 Speaker 1 

I'll only do it once the project is done or has had some success. 

00:01:39 Speaker 1 

I still have to. 

00:01:41 Speaker 1 

Build it. 

00:01:43 Speaker 1 

Build the models. 

00:01:47 Speaker 1 

Then I'll have to upload all the code. 

00:01:53 Speaker 1 

Plus change it all. 

00:02:01 Speaker 1 

The code to change it to beeps and boops is all in Python. 

00:02:06 Speaker 1 

So I don't know how I'm going to transfer it to C#. C++. 

00:02:10 Speaker 1 

But it should work. 

00:02:15 Speaker 1
