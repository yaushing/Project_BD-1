FANO Russia will hold a final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations ( FANO Russia ) , in joint cooperation with RAS , will hold the third Expert Session on “ Evaluating the effectiveness of activities of scientific organizations ” .
The gathering will be the final one in a series of meetings held by the agency over the course of the year , reports a press release delivered to the editorial offices of Lenta.ru.
At the third meeting , it is planned that the results of the work conducted by the Expert Session over the past year will be presented and that a final checklist to evaluate the effectiveness of scientific organizations will be developed .
In addition , participants at the event plan to discuss the rules for forming an expert panel , which is responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups , as well as the criteria for carrying out evaluations .
The third Expert Session will be the final meeting in a series of events on the formation of a unified approach for all three academies to the evaluation of the effectiveness of activities of scientific organizations .
Over the past five months , we were able to achieve this , and the final version of the regulatory documents is undergoing approval .
According to the plans for the upcoming session , we should complete the development of procedures for scientometric and expert analysis , and come to an agreement on the stages and timeframes for the evaluation process ” , said the Head of FANO ’ s Expert-Analytical Department , Elena Aksenova .
Representatives from more than one hundred Russian scientific institutes will take part in the event .
It is expected that a resolution will be adopted based on its results .
The meeting will begin at 10 am , Moscow time , on September 16 , 2014 , at the following address : 14 Solyanka Street , Moscow .
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California , Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters .
It is expected that the experts ’ discovery will make it possible to search for stars that are related to one another , that is to say , those stars that emerged from the same cluster .
The authors published the results of their study in the journal , Nature , but one can briefly get acquainted with them on the university ’ s website .
The reason for the homogeneous chemical composition of adjacent stars turns out to be turbulent mixing in the gas clouds where stars are created .
Even if the newly formed star later leaves the star cluster , its chemical composition will make it possible to determine its place of birth and the region where related stars were formed .
Previously , scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside of a cluster could result in differences in its chemical composition compared to related stars in a cluster .
The results of the simulations conducted by the astrophysicists prove that such differences should not occur .
The experts used a supercomputer in their research to simulate two streams of interstellar gas , which combined to form a cloud .
Over the course of several million years and under the force of its own gravitational pull , the object turned into a cluster , in which protostars began to form .
The scientists added indicating dye to the original gas streams and determined that the high level of chemical homogeneity was a result of the fast turbulent mixing in the cloud .
The astrophysicists believe that their study proves that it ’ s possible to look for related stars on the basis of chemical composition , as well as to determine the possible regions where these objects were formed .

Lavrov : Russia will not “ slam the door ” in the face of new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “ slam the door ” in the face of new sanctions .
This was stated by the head of Russia ’ s MFA , Sergei Lavrov , while speaking in front of students and faculty members at MGIMO University .
I won &apos;t even expound on or indulge in fantastical thinking about our counter measures in the event of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions , because everything should be specifically calculated , he said .
And when we understand what our European and American partners are worthy of this time around , that is when we will make a decision about how to respond .
It will not be connected with door slamming , or some falsely understood grievances , the minister emphasized .
We , first and foremost , will be guided by our interests , interests to protect our economy , social sphere , our citizens , our business sector , and we will draw conclusions from our partners ’ actions on the basis of their appropriateness , ability to come to an agreement , and reliability .
On the basis of the steps that have been taken in the area of sanctions , it ’ s possible to soundly judge what our partners are trying to accomplish ” , the head of the Russian MFA continued .
If they are shouting at the top of their lungs that ‘ they will also be sanctions for us , but we have to take such measures in order to punish Russia ’ , this is probably not very appropriate . ”
As far as Russia ’ s leaving the WTO in response to potential new sanctions is concerned , the answer is no .
On the contrary , we want to more actively master the WTO instruments , including when the issue concerns trade disagreements , Lavrov stated .
We have already used this instrument in order to overcome what we see as discriminatory policies by the EU in the area of antidumping procedures .
According to the minister , Russia has been accused of dumping , and , as such , antidumping measures have been taken against sectors of the Russian economy .
“ We are also prepared to use WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position against introducing the norms of the EU ’ s third energy package retroactively ” , Lavrov said .
How to effectively use lilacs in garden design ?
Irina Okuneva answers our questions :
Since lilacs loose their nice appearance once they have dropped their flowers , it is a good idea to plant them together with other bushes .
They fit very nicely with many plants .
Moreover , one can and should plant lilacs beside both plants that bloom at different times and those that bloom at the same time as it .
Another bonus of lilacs is that they offer so many opportunities to get creative .
You can shape them into a standard tree of various heights , an attractive bush , a bush with a wide base , or even into something resembling a garden bonsai tree with a whimsical bent stock .
Just pick out the shape that works best with the design of your garden .
