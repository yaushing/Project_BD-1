<seg id="1">FANO Russia will hold a final Expert Session</seg>
<seg id="2">The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia), in joint cooperation with RAS, will hold the third Expert Session on “Evaluating the effectiveness of activities of scientific organizations”.</seg>
<seg id="3">The gathering will be the final one in a series of meetings held by the agency over the course of the year, reports a press release delivered to the editorial offices of Lenta.ru.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the third meeting, it is planned that the results of the work conducted by the Expert Session over the past year will be presented and that a final checklist to evaluate the effectiveness of scientific organizations will be developed.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition, participants at the event plan to discuss the rules for forming an expert panel, which is responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups, as well as the criteria for carrying out evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="6">The third Expert Session will be the final meeting in a series of events on the formation of a unified approach for all three academies to the evaluation of the effectiveness of activities of scientific organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the past five months, we were able to achieve this, and the final version of the regulatory documents is undergoing approval.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the plans for the upcoming session, we should complete the development of procedures for scientometric and expert analysis, and come to an agreement on the stages and timeframes for the evaluation process”, said the Head of FANO’s Expert-Analytical Department, Elena Aksenova.</seg>
<seg id="9">Representatives from more than one hundred Russian scientific institutes will take part in the event.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is expected that a resolution will be adopted based on its results.</seg>
<seg id="11">The meeting will begin at 10 am, Moscow time, on September 16, 2014, at the following address: 14 Solyanka Street, Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists have found a way to detect related stars</seg>
<seg id="2">Astrophysicists from the University of California, Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is expected that the experts’ discovery will make it possible to search for stars that are related to one another, that is to say, those stars that emerged from the same cluster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The authors published the results of their study in the journal, Nature, but one can briefly get acquainted with them on the university’s website.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reason for the homogeneous chemical composition of adjacent stars turns out to be turbulent mixing in the gas clouds where stars are created.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even if the newly formed star later leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition will make it possible to determine its place of birth and the region where related stars were formed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside of a cluster could result in differences in its chemical composition compared to related stars in a cluster.</seg>
<seg id="8">The results of the simulations conducted by the astrophysicists prove that such differences should not occur.</seg>
<seg id="9">The experts used a supercomputer in their research to simulate two streams of interstellar gas, which combined to form a cloud.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over the course of several million years and under the force of its own gravitational pull, the object turned into a cluster, in which protostars began to form.</seg>
<seg id="11">The scientists added indicating dye to the original gas streams and determined that the high level of chemical homogeneity was a result of the fast turbulent mixing in the cloud.</seg>
<seg id="12">The astrophysicists believe that their study proves that it’s possible to look for related stars on the basis of chemical composition, as well as to determine the possible regions where these objects were formed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lavrov: Russia will not “slam the door” in the face of new sanctions and will not leave the WTO</seg>
<seg id="2">Russia will not “slam the door” in the face of new sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was stated by the head of Russia’s MFA, Sergei Lavrov, while speaking in front of students and faculty members at MGIMO University.</seg>
<seg id="4">I won't even expound on or indulge in fantastical thinking about our counter measures in the event of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, because everything should be specifically calculated, he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">And when we understand what our European and American partners are worthy of this time around, that is when we will make a decision about how to respond.</seg>
<seg id="6">It will not be connected with door slamming, or some falsely understood grievances, the minister emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="7">We, first and foremost, will be guided by our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business sector, and we will draw conclusions from our partners’ actions on the basis of their appropriateness, ability to come to an agreement, and reliability.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the basis of the steps that have been taken in the area of sanctions, it’s possible to soundly judge what our partners are trying to accomplish”, the head of the Russian MFA continued.</seg>
<seg id="9">If they are shouting at the top of their lungs that ‘they will also be sanctions for us, but we have to take such measures in order to punish Russia’, this is probably not very appropriate.”</seg>
<seg id="10">As far as Russia’s leaving the WTO in response to potential new sanctions is concerned, the answer is no.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the contrary, we want to more actively master the WTO instruments, including when the issue concerns trade disagreements, Lavrov stated.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have already used this instrument in order to overcome what we see as discriminatory policies by the EU in the area of antidumping procedures.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the minister, Russia has been accused of dumping, and, as such, antidumping measures have been taken against sectors of the Russian economy.</seg>
<seg id="14">“We are also prepared to use WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position against introducing the norms of the EU’s third energy package retroactively”, Lavrov said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Irina Okuneva answers our questions:</seg>
<seg id="3">Since lilacs loose their nice appearance once they have dropped their flowers, it is a good idea to plant them together with other bushes.</seg>
<seg id="4">They fit very nicely with many plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moreover, one can and should plant lilacs beside both plants that bloom at different times and those that bloom at the same time as it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another bonus of lilacs is that they offer so many opportunities to get creative.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can shape them into a standard tree of various heights, an attractive bush, a bush with a wide base, or even into something resembling a garden bonsai tree with a whimsical bent stock.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just pick out the shape that works best with the design of your garden.</seg>
