        <definition>Semantic types that inherit from this abstract type are used to mark lexical units that have some notable pragmatic dimension to their meaning, e.g., Positive_judgement for a word like "thrifty" (see Frugality.thrifty.a) and Question_function for a word like "who" (see Person.who.n).</definition>

It is also used to denote the opinion of the speaker associated with words in several other frames (such as Frugality and Appearance), including a more heterogeneous variety of words having the prefixes 'mis-', 'under-', and 'over-'.

        <definition>This semantic type signals that the marked LU is dedicated for use in questions. The FE that is to be questioned is underdetermined by this semantic type, but is inferrable as the sole Core FE in the frame of the LU (e.g., Person in the People frame for the LU People.who.n) or the most focal (non-topical) FE in a frame with multiple Core FEs (e.g., Profiled_region in the Locative_relation frame for where.adv).</definition>

    <semType abbrev="Non-p" name="Non-perspectivalized_frame" ID="52">
        <definition>This semantic type marks frames that do not impose a perspective on the situation portrayed by the frame.  An example is the Commerce frame, in which a Lexical Unit like commerce.n denotes an interaction between participants (Buyer, Seller, Money, and Goods) but profiles none of them.  An important consequence of the lack of perspective is that the opposition of core, periperal, and extrathematic frame elements is not relevant.</definition>

        <definition>This ST is used for LUs of a frame that cannot be used (for interpretation or generation) unless they co-occur with the right other words as governors or dependents.  (The limiting case, where a precise group of words must
all co-occur in order to evoke a frame, is handled in FrameNet by the use of multi-word lexical units.)  
The Support subtype of bound lexical unit is exemplified by give with a causal meaning:

Receiving the notification so late almost gave me a heart attack.

Give.v in the Causation frame is usable with a large number of dependents denoting the Effect, but not all:

Releasing these old files nearly gave a disaster.

The Bound_dependent_LU type is used for LUs like pickle.n in the Predicament frame, which occurs virtually only with the supports in and out of.
