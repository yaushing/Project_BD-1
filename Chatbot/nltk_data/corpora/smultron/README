SMULTRON Corpus Sample

http://www.ling.su.se/DaLi/research/smultron/index.htm

SMULTRON (Stockholm MULtilingual TReebank) is a parallel treebank developed
by the Computational Linguistics Group at the Department of Linguistics,
at Stockholm University. The parallel treebank contains around 1000
sentences in English, German and Swedish. The sentences have been
PoS-tagged and annotated with phrase structure trees. The trees have
been aligned on sentence, phrase and word level. Additionally, the
German and Swedish monolingual treebanks contain lemma information.

The sample consists of approximately 80 sentences (8%) of the corpus,
and is distributed with permission.
